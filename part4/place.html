                <p>Great stay at Minas Tirith! Between the 7 floors with no elevator and orcs screaming downstairs, I got in shape… and so did my screams! The panoramic balcony is perfect for watching battles, but avoid the Wi-Fi—it’s faster to send a raven. Would definitely do it again (with good sneakers)!</p>

                <p>Helm’s Deep was the ultimate survival challenge! Thick walls, nonstop Uruk-hai screams, and the complimentary rain made it feel like home. Just don’t ask about the catapult service—it’s more of a “you’re on your own” kind of thing.</p>

                <p>Foncombe is lovely if you enjoy endless harp music and cryptic poetry that makes your head spin. The beds sing poems, which is cool… until you want to sleep. A great place to run away from your problems, or your relatives.</p>

                <p>Mordor’s heating system is top-notch (lava everywhere!), but the air quality? Not so much. The giant flaming eye is an interesting touch, but privacy is definitely not a thing here. Perfect for introverts who don’t mind a little apocalypse.</p>

                <p>Moria is the place if you love echo, darkness, and surprise appearances by shadowy creatures. The pet Balrog isn’t exactly friendly, and the stairs keep you guessing. Not for the faint-hearted—but great for thrill seekers!</p>

                <p>The Prancing Pony has charm and ale in abundance, though the walls are as thin as paper. Perfect for loud nights and mysterious guests. Just don’t expect a quiet stay if the hobbits get singing!</p>
